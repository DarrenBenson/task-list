## Busy Parent Sam

**Role:** Stay-at-home parent / part-time worker
**Technical Proficiency:** Novice
**Primary Goal:** Capture tasks quickly before forgetting them

### Background

Sam juggles household responsibilities, childcare, and occasional freelance work. They've tried various task apps but found most too complicated or time-consuming to maintain. Sam needs something that works instantly without a learning curve. They typically use their phone one-handed while managing other activities.

### Needs & Motivations

- Instant task capture (under 5 seconds)
- Visual clarity at a glance
- Simple interface with no hidden features
- Satisfying sense of progress when completing tasks

### Pain Points

- Apps with too many features and settings
- Onboarding tutorials that waste time
- Tasks getting lost in complex folder/project structures
- Having to think about "categories" or "priorities" when they just want to note something down

### Typical Tasks

- "Pick up milk"
- "Call dentist"
- "Pay electricity bill by Friday"
- "Return Amazon package"

### Quote

> "I just need to get it out of my head and onto a list before I forget."

## Organised Ollie

**Role:** Retiree / home organiser
**Technical Proficiency:** Novice to Intermediate
**Primary Goal:** Keep life organised with a clear, ordered list

### Background

Ollie is methodical and likes having a clear view of what needs doing. They've used paper lists for years but want a digital solution that persists and can be easily reordered. Ollie appreciates being able to drag tasks into priority order and sees the list as a reflection of their organised mindset. They use a tablet or laptop rather than phone.

### Needs & Motivations

- Ability to reorder tasks by importance
- Persistent storage (data doesn't disappear)
- Clear visual distinction between done and not done
- No clutter or distractions

### Pain Points

- Lists that auto-sort and ignore manual ordering
- Completed tasks disappearing before they can review them
- Apps that require accounts, subscriptions, or cloud sync
- Small touch targets that are hard to tap accurately

### Typical Tasks

- Weekly meal planning items
- Home maintenance reminders
- Appointment preparation checklists
- Shopping lists ordered by store layout

### Quote

> "I want my list the way I arranged it, not the way some algorithm thinks it should be."
